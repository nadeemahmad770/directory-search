# directory-search

We have 2 Endpoints here 
1. directory/v1/load
2. directory/v1/search?data=r

If you are using 1st endpoint then you'll see a UI to test the function. There is a text box you can make your directory search from there.
2nd endpoint is the REST-API you will be getting the JSON response in here.
